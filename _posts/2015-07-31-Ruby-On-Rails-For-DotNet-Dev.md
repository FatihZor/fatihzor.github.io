## Ruby vs .Net

- Ruby is interpreted

	class person
		puts "Hi, I'm jasper"
		
		def Speak
			puts "Hi, I am jasper"
		end
	end
	
	ruby> person.rb
	Hi, I'm jasper
	
think about whether it will the same result in C#? the answer is obvious: NO!

- Ruby is dynamic language
  
  Howerver C# is static language.
  		
  		title = "I am string"
  		title = 1+1
  		puts title

- Everything is a Object in ruby

		puts true.class
		puts 1.clss
		puts "hello".class
